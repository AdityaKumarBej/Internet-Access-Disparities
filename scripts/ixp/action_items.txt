Number of Facilities and Their Locations: Mapping facilities across counties or states can show which regions have more access points to IXPs, potentially leading to better internet quality.

Participant Count and Network Type in IXs: Higher participant counts generally mean more networks exchanging traffic at that IXP, potentially resulting in lower latency and better speeds for users in that area.

Traffic Volume and Peak Traffic at IXs: Assessing traffic volumes and peak hours at IXPs can help you understand the demand and potential load capacity, which affects performance.
