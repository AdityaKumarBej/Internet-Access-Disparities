To start collecting IXP (Internet Exchange Point) data, follow these steps:

1. **Gather Data on IXPs**: You can access IXP data from sources like **PeeringDB** (an open database with details on IXPs globally), and **IXP Database** maintained by Internet Society, which has a focus on internet exchange infrastructure. This data typically includes the location, participants, and traffic volumes of each IXP.

2. **Map IXPs to Geographic Units**: Since you already have data at the CBG, county, state, and Woodard nations levels, mapping each IXP’s proximity to these geographic units will be crucial. This step will allow you to analyze IXP influence on internet performance metrics by region.

3. **Data Cleaning and Integration**: Ensure consistent formatting of geographic identifiers between IXP data and your OOKLA and MLAB data to enable seamless integration and comparison.

**Other Parameters to Consider**:
- **Network Latency**: Include latency measurements, as IXPs can have a significant impact on reducing latency.
- **Network Congestion**: Assess periods of peak congestion to see if IXPs correlate with improved congestion mitigation.
- **Distance to Nearest IXP**: Calculate the physical or network “hop” distance from users or CBGs to the nearest IXP, as proximity often impacts speed and latency.
- **ISP Infrastructure**: Data on ISPs and their connectivity to IXPs might indicate how well local internet infrastructure utilizes these exchanges.
- **Socioeconomic Factors**: Factors like median household income, education levels, or urban-rural classifications could reveal how socioeconomic conditions impact access to IXPs and overall internet quality.

Including these additional factors will help you determine if IXPs directly or indirectly influence the quality and speed of internet access across various U.S. regions.

In the context of IXPs (Internet Exchange Points) in PeeringDB, understanding **facilities**, **IXs**, and **locations** is crucial, as each plays a unique role in the internet infrastructure. Here’s a breakdown of each and how they relate to your research on internet access disparities:

### 1. **Facilities**
   - **Definition**: Facilities in PeeringDB refer to **data centers** or physical buildings that house infrastructure for ISPs, IXPs, and other network participants. Facilities provide the physical space where routers, switches, and servers are housed, enabling networks to connect directly to each other.
   - **For Your Research**: Facilities are essential for understanding where networks can physically connect with IXPs. Knowing the facilities associated with an IXP can help you determine:
     - **Proximity**: The geographic distance between a user’s location and the nearest facility housing an IXP.
     - **Access**: Whether the region or city has nearby facilities with IXP presence, which could directly influence internet performance and availability.

### 2. **IXs (Internet Exchanges)**
   - **Definition**: An IX or IXP is the platform where ISPs and network providers interconnect and exchange traffic. IXPs are crucial for reducing internet traffic latency and improving speed by routing traffic locally instead of through longer, international routes.
   - **For Your Research**: IXs are the core focus of your study, as they directly impact:
     - **Network Latency**: IXPs allow for more direct routing of traffic, which typically improves internet speed and quality in nearby areas.
     - **Traffic Volume**: IXs with high traffic volume and many participants generally indicate a robust network exchange, likely benefiting the region with higher internet quality and reliability.

### 3. **Locations**
   - **Definition**: In PeeringDB, **location** refers to the geographic coordinates or address of each facility or IXP. This helps to map where IXPs and their associated facilities are physically situated.
   - **For Your Research**: Location data allows you to:
     - **Map IXPs to Geographic Regions**: By knowing the exact locations of IXPs and facilities, you can align them with your speed test data hierarchies (CBG, county, state, Woodard nations) to evaluate proximity effects.
     - **Compare Internet Quality and IXP Proximity**: If you find that regions closer to IXPs consistently show higher internet speeds or quality, it might indicate that proximity to IXPs influences internet access quality.

### Helpful Data for Your Research
- **Number of Facilities and Their Locations**: Mapping facilities across counties or states can show which regions have more access points to IXPs, potentially leading to better internet quality.
- **Participant Count and Network Type in IXs**: Higher participant counts generally mean more networks exchanging traffic at that IXP, potentially resulting in lower latency and better speeds for users in that area.
- **Traffic Volume and Peak Traffic at IXs**: Assessing traffic volumes and peak hours at IXPs can help you understand the demand and potential load capacity, which affects performance.

Using facilities, IXs, and location data in conjunction with your speed test data will help you determine if, and to what extent, IXP proximity impacts internet quality across different regions in the U.S.
